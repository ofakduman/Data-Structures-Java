     * 11. One method of solving a continuous numerical function for a root implements a technique similar
     * to the binary search. Given a numerical function, defined as f(x), and two values of x that are
     * known to bracket one of the roots, an approximation to this root can be determined through a
     * method of repeated division of this bracket. For a set of values of x to bracket a root, the value of
     * the function for one x must be negative and the other must be positive as illustrated below, which
     * plots f(x) for values of x between x1 and x2.
     *  The algorithm requires that the midpoint between x1 and x2 be evaluated in the function, and if
     * it equals zero the root is found; otherwise, x1 or x2 is set to this midpoint. To determine whether
     * to replace x1 or x2, the sign of the midpoint is compared against the signs of the values f(x1) and
     * f(x2). The midpoint replaces the x (x1 or x2) whose function value has the same sign as the function
     * value at the midpoint.
     *This algorithm can be written recursively. The terminating conditions are true when either the
     * midpoint evaluated in the function is zero or the absolute value of x1 â€“ x2 is less than some small
     * predetermined value (e.g., 0.0005). If the second condition occurs, then the root is said to be
     * approximately equal to the last midpoint.
