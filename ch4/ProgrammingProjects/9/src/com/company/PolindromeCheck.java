/**
 * A class which has one method for check line(given string) is polindrom or not with given conditions:
 * 9. Another approach to checking for palindromes would be to store the characters of the string being
 * checked in a stack and then remove half of the characters, pushing them onto a second stack. When
 * you are finished, if the two stacks are equal, then the string is a palindrome. This works fine if the
 * string has an even number of characters. If the string has an odd number of characters, an additional
 * character should be removed from the original stack before the two stacks are compared. It
 * does not matter what this character is because it doesnâ€™t have to be matched. Design, code, and test
 * a program that implements this approach.
