     * 14. Write a program that simulates the operation of a busy airport that has only two run‐ways to handle
     * all takeoffs and landings. You may assume that each takeoff or landing takes 15 minutes to
     * complete. One runway request is made during each 5‐minute time interval, and the likelihood of a
     * landing request is the same as for a takeoff request.
     * Priority is given to planes requesting a landing. If a request cannot be honored, it is added to a
     * takeoff or landing queue.
     * Your program should simulate 120 minutes of activity at the airport. Each request for runway
     * clearance should be time‐stamped and added to the appropriate queue. The output from your program
     * should include the final queue contents, the number of take‐offs completed, the number of
     * landings completed, and the average number of minutes spent in each queue.
