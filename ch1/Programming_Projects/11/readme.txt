11. For the shape class hierarchy discussed in Section 1.8, consider adding classes DrawableRectangle, 
DrawableCircle, and so on that would have additional data fields and methods that would enable a shape to be drawn on a monitor. Provide an interface DrawableInt that specifies the methods required for drawing a shape. Class DrawableRectangle, for example, should extend 
Rectangle and implement this interface. Draw the new class hierarchy and write the new interface and classes. Using the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to draw objects is described in 
Appendix Section C.7.
