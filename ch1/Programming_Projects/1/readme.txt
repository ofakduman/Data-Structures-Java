1. A veterinary office wants to store information regarding the kinds of animals it treats. Data includes 
diet, whether the animal is nocturnal, whether its bite is poisonous (as for some snakes), whether it 
flies, and so on. Use a superclass Pet with abstract methods and create appropriate subclasses to 
support about 10 animals of your choice.
