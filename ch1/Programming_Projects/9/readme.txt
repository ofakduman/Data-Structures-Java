9. A company has two different kinds of employees: professional and nonprofessional. Generally, professional employees have a monthly salary, whereas nonprofessional employees are paid an hourly 
rate. Similarly, professional employees have a certain number of days of vacation, whereas nonprofessional employees receive vacation hours based on the number of hours they have worked. The 
amount contributed for health insurance is also different for each kind of employee. Use an abstract 
class Employee to store information common to all employees and to declare methods for calculating weekly salary and computing health care contributions and vacation days earned that week.
