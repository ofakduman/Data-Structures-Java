/**A student is a person, and so is an employee. Create a class Person that has the data attributes
 common to both students and employees (name, social security number, age, gender,
 address, and telephone number) and appropriate method definitions. A student has a
 grade‚Äêpoint average (GPA), major, and year of graduation. An employee has a department,
 job title, and year of hire. In addition, there are hourly employees (hourly rate, hours worked,
 and union dues) and salaried employees (annual salary). Define a class hierarchy and write an
 application class that you can use to first store the data for an array of people and then display
 that information in a meaningful
 way.*/
