2. A student is a person, and so is an employee. Create a class Person that has the data attributes common to both students and employees (name, social security number, age, gender, address, and telephone number) and appropriate method definitions. A student has a grade‚Äêpoint average (GPA), 
major, and year of graduation. An employee has a department, job title, and year of hire. In addition, 
there are hourly employees (hourly rate, hours worked, and union dues) and salaried employees 
(annual salary). Define a class hierarchy and write an application class that you can use to first store 
the data for an array of people and then display that information in a meaningful way.
