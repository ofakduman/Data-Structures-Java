the total calories for these foods and the overall percentages of fat, protein, and carbohydrates for 
this list. To find the overall percentage, if an item has 200 calories and 10 percent is fat calories, then 
that item contributes 20 fat calories. You need to find the totals for fat calories, protein calories, and 
carbohydrate calories and then calculate the percentages.
