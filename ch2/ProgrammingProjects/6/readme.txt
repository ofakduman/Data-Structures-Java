6. The Josephus problem is named after the historian Flavius Josephus, who lived between the years 37 
and 100 CE. Josephus was also a reluctant leader of the Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire. 
When it appeared that Josephus and his band were to be captured, they resolved to kill themselves. 
Josephus persuaded the group by saying, “Let us commit our mutual deaths to determination by lot. 
He to whom the first lot falls, let him be killed by him that hath the second lot, and thus fortune shall 
make its progress through us all; nor shall any of us perish by his own right hand, for it would be 
unfair if, when the rest are gone, somebody should repent and save himself” (Flavius Josephus, The 
Wars of the Jews, Book III, Chapter 8, Verse 7, tr. William Whiston, 1737). Yet that is exactly what 
happened; Josephus was left for last, and he and the person he was to kill surrendered to the Romans. 
Although Josephus does not describe how the lots were assigned, the following approach is generally 
believed to be the way it was done. People form a circle and count around the circle some predetermined number. When this number is reached, that person receives a lot and leaves the circle. The 
count starts over with the next person. Using the circular‐linked list developed in Exercise 4, simulate this problem. Your program should take two parameters: n, the number of people who start, and 
m, the number of counts. For example, try n 20 and m 12. Where does Josephus need to be in 
the original list so that he is the last one chosen?
