/**
     * Programming Project
     * 3. Provide a multiple method for your polynomial class. To multiply, you iterate through polynomial A
     * and then multiply all terms of polynomial B by the current term of polynomial A. You then add each
     * term you get by multiplying two terms to the polynomial result.
     * Hint: to multiply two terms, multiply their coefficients and add their exponents. For example,2x^3 multiply 4x^2 is  8x^5.
